    "text": "I am a social and cognitive psychologist interested in belief formation and change. I blend psychology with data science techniques to identify meaningful patterns in social media data that reflect public perceptions and opinions. I have applied my methods to pressing societal issues, such as climate change, the influence of misinformation, and detection of research with misconduct or integrity concerns. A more comprehensive account of my history can be found in my curriculum vitae.\nI hold a postdoctoral fellowship Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The aim of my current research is to develop semi-automated approaches to monitor social acceptance and social change concerning the marine environment. Building on social psychology theory and current advances in Big Data, I provide intelligence on public perceptions and warning about events needing intervention to pre-empt conflicts and ensure public support.\n\nRecent updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew website, thanks to Quarto\n\n\nQuarto is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n\n\nMatthew Andreotta\n\n\nOct 4, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Today, I upload a new version of my academic website. All thanks to the magic of ✨ Quarto ✨.\nFor the unaware, Quarto is an open-source publishing system. I first started using Quarto to seamlessly use Python and R in the same markdown document. But Quarto can do so much more: books, presentations, and of course, websites.\nOverall, the process of building rather painless. Partly because Quarto has comprehensive documentation and partly because I followed the footsteps of those before me. For readers interested in building a website with Quarto, here are the websites I found useful:"

    "text": "I am a social and cognitive psychologist interested in belief formation and change. I blend psychology with data science techniques to identify meaningful patterns in social media data that reflect public perceptions and opinions. I have applied my methods to pressing societal issues, such as climate change, the influence of misinformation, and detection of research with misconduct or integrity concerns. More broadly, I aim to make science more accessible to scientists and the public alike. A more comprehensive account of my history can be found in my curriculum vitae.\nI hold a postdoctoral fellowship Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The aim of my current research is to develop semi-automated approaches to monitor social acceptance and social change concerning the marine environment. Building on social psychology theory and current advances in Big Data, I aim to pre-empt conflict and identify the antecedents of public support.\nI am open to collaborations, invitations for guest lectures, co-supervision of students, and projects that increase the accessibility of science.

    "title": "New article: “Evidence for three distinct climate change audience segments with varying belief updating tendencies”",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The abstract for the peer-reviewed research paper is available below:\n\nMounting evidence suggests members of the general public are not homogeneous in their receptivity to climate science information. Studies segmenting climate change views typically deploy a top-down approach, whereby concepts salient in scientific literature determine the number and nature of segments. In contrast, in two studies using Australian citizens, we used a bottom-up approach, in which segments were determined from perceptions of climate change concepts derived from citizen social media discourse. In Study 1, we identified three segments of the Australian public (Acceptors, Fencesitters, and Sceptics) and their psychological characteristics. We find segments differ in climate change concern and scepticism, mental models of climate, political ideology, and worldviews. In Study 2, we examined whether reception to scientific information differed across segments using a belief-updating task. Participants reported their beliefs concerning the causes of climate change, the likelihood climate change will have specific impacts, and the effectiveness of Australia’s mitigation policy. Next, participants were provided with the actual scientific estimates for each event and asked to provide new estimates. We find significant heterogeneity in the belief-updating tendencies of the three segments that can be understood with reference to their different psychological characteristics. Our results suggest tailored scientific communications informed by the psychological profiles of different segments may be more effective than a `one-size-fits-all’ approach. Using our novel audience segmentation analysis, we provide some practical suggestions regarding how communication strategies can be improved by accounting for segments’ characteristics.\n\nYou can read more about this research in the freely-available preprint.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{andreotta2022,\n  author = {Matthew Andreotta},\n  title = {New Article: “{Evidence} for Three Distinct Climate Change\n    Audience Segments with Varying Belief Updating Tendencies”},\n  date = {2022-10-06},\n  url = {https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2022-10-06_new-article},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMatthew Andreotta. 2022. “New Article: ‘Evidence for Three\nDistinct Climate Change Audience Segments with Varying Belief Updating\nTendencies’.” October 6, 2022. https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2022-10-06_new-article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety received a total of 10,574 submissions, 6,800 telephone calls to an information line, and heard 641 witnesses. These submissions lead to two reports: an Interim Report in 2019 and a Final Report in 2021. In the Interim and Final Report, we found mentions of the word “pain”. This is isn’t entirely surprising, given pain affects the vast majority of older Australians, and is often under-diagnosed and under-treated. What was surprising was that in the Royal Commissions 148 recommendations to improve aged care, there was not a single mention of the word pain. Although the Royal Commission discussed pain in their reports, the topic was omitted from recommendations, reflecting a lack of attention to the presented evidence Without specific recommendations for pain management, a disconnection may arise between targeted polices, programs and funding schemes, and the clinical practice. Thus, older adults living in the community and residential aged care homes may remain vulnerable.

I blend psychology with data science techniques to identify meaningful patterns in social media data that reflect public perceptions and opinions. I have applied my methods to pressing societal issues, such as climate change, the influence of misinformation, and detection of research with misconduct or integrity concerns. More broadly, I aim to make science more accessible to scientists and the public alike. A more comprehensive account of my history can be found in my academic curriculum vitae.\nI hold a postdoctoral fellowship Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

    "section": "",
    "text": "The abstract for the peer-reviewed research paper is available below:\n\nMounting evidence suggests members of the general public are not homogeneous in their receptivity to climate science information. Studies segmenting climate change views typically deploy a top-down approach, whereby concepts salient in scientific literature determine the number and nature of segments. In contrast, in two studies using Australian citizens, we used a bottom-up approach, in which segments were determined from perceptions of climate change concepts derived from citizen social media discourse. In Study 1, we identified three segments of the Australian public (Acceptors, Fencesitters, and Sceptics) and their psychological characteristics. We find segments differ in climate change concern and scepticism, mental models of climate, political ideology, and worldviews. In Study 2, we examined whether reception to scientific information differed across segments using a belief-updating task. Participants reported their beliefs concerning the causes of climate change, the likelihood climate change will have specific impacts, and the effectiveness of Australia’s mitigation policy. Next, participants were provided with the actual scientific estimates for each event and asked to provide new estimates. We find significant heterogeneity in the belief-updating tendencies of the three segments that can be understood with reference to their different psychological characteristics. Our results suggest tailored scientific communications informed by the psychological profiles of different segments may be more effective than a `one-size-fits-all’ approach. Using our novel audience segmentation analysis, we provide some practical suggestions regarding how communication strategies can be improved by accounting for segments’ characteristics.\n\nYou can read more about this research in the freely-available preprint.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{andreotta2022,\n  author = {Matthew Andreotta},\n  title = {New Article: “{Evidence} for Three Distinct Climate Change\n    Audience Segments with Varying Belief Updating Tendencies”},\n  date = {2022-10-06},\n  url = {https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2022-10-06_new-article},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMatthew Andreotta. 2022. “New Article: ‘Evidence for Three\nDistinct Climate Change Audience Segments with Varying Belief Updating\nTendencies’.” October 6, 2022. https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2022-10-06_new-article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety received a total of 10,574 submissions, 6,800 telephone calls to an information line, and heard 641 witnesses. These submissions lead to two reports: an Interim Report in 2019 and a Final Report in 2021. In the Interim and Final Report, we found mentions of the word “pain”. This is isn’t entirely surprising, given pain affects the vast majority of older Australians, and is often under-diagnosed and under-treated. What was surprising was that in the Royal Commissions 148 recommendations to improve aged care, there was not a single mention of the word pain. Although the Royal Commission discussed pain in their reports, the topic was omitted from recommendations, reflecting a lack of attention to the presented evidence. Without specific recommendations for pain management, a disconnection may arise between targeted polices, funding schemes, and the clinical practice. Thus, older adults living in the community and residential aged care homes may remain vulnerable.

Using automated text analysis, we explored the concept of pain in the Australian Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. We found that pain was mentioned in evidence provided to the commission but was absent from the commission's recommendations.Our research shows that automated text analyses can identify where evidence and recommendations diverge. Without specific recommendations for pain management, polices, funding schemes, and clinical practice may miss opportunities to help with the common experience of pain. As a result, older adults living in the community and residential aged care homes may remain vulnerable.\n            \n        \n        \n2022\nAndreotta, M., Boschetti, F., Farrell, S., Paris, C., Walker, I., & Hurlstone, M.

This is called a 'top-down' approach. In this study, we used a 'bottom-up' approach, where we measured climate change views based on reactions to social media posts. We found three segments of people:Acceptors. People who think climate change is mainly caused by humans and seek climate change action.Sceptics. People who think climate change is either not happening, or caused by natural fluctuations unrelated to humans.Fencesitters. People who do not lean either way.We found that each segment had their own unique psychological characteristics which underpin their openness to climate science information. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of communication varies for each individual, and a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is not optimal. Using our findings, we provided some practical recommendations for tailoring climate change communication to each segment.\n            \n        \n        \nCalder, S., Andreotta, M., Morris, T., & Atee, M.

For example, pastoral care is a broad service that involves religious, spiritual, emotional, and social support for people during difficult times. In this research, we developed and tested a digital tool to measure pastoral care, including who was receiving pastoral care, what form of care was provided, and the time taken to provide the care.After a one-year trial, we found our digital tool was well-used and well-received. Those providing pastoral care felt it was more feasible, favourable, and easier to use than paper-based recording. Our study demonstrates how broad services may be quantified to record, monitor, and improve caregiving to vulnerable people.\n            \n        \n        \n2021\nEcker, U. K. H., Sze, B. K.

Some theorists propose that people may continue to rely on misinformation because it is consistent with their political views of the world. To test this, we investigated whether Americans' political beliefs affected reliance on false information even after being corrected. While political beliefs influenced people's initial response, the correction was equally effective for both Democrats and Republicans. However, Republicans did show stronger emotional responses to information that conflicted with their beliefs. Our results suggest retracting false information is effective, even in polarising political contexts. Though, communicators should be weary of expressions of anger when retracting misinformation consistent with the views of Republicans.\n            \n        \n        \n2019\nAndreotta, M., Nugroho, R., Hurlstone, M.

Often, data scientists build language models to understand the 'big data' of the Internet. However, language models do not always produce sensical results, as they rely on the statistical relationships of text rather than the psychosocial context and meaning of words. Qualitative research excels in mapping context to behaviour but is cumbersome or impossible for large data sets.In this study, we proposed a four-step framework for blending data science and qualitative research to bolster each approaches strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. We demonstrate the success of this approach with an application to climate change commentary on social media.

Marine scientists are expected to contribute to decision-making not only by providing scientific evidence but also effective communication and persuasion.We reviewed how humans organise knowledge and beliefs, and how they affect decision-making and reception of information. By using the theory of mental models and the Causal Layered Analysis, the structure underlying the organisation of scientific and non-scientific knowledge can be reduced to a common framework.Our review provides tools that marine scientists can use when communicating, to best understand their audience and their knowledge.\n            \n        \n        \nWorking Papers\n2023\nJellison, S., Andreotta, M., Cooper, C., Paris, P., Nugroho, R., & Vassar, M.

    "text": "When analysing text, often I want to visualise the aggregate characteristic of a document or corpus. For example, in a sentiment analysis, I might want to showing the average number of words associated with each emotion in each document. This reduces entire documents to a single point on a visualisation, which can allow readers to intuitively grasp the variation of emotions between documents. But, this form of visualisation does not give readers an intuitive sense of which part of a document contains emotional content, or even what word is related to which emotion. The most curious of readers might read up on the details of the sentiment analysis, but many won’t, leaving readers untrusting or uncertain of the analysis and results.\nI think interactive data visualisations can help here. Broadly, interactive data visualisations are graphical representations of data which respond to user input, such as a click of a mouse or numbers typed into a keyboard. Interaction can be used to clarify specific data values or hand over control to readers. For example, the graphic below represents the number of Australians for each year of age, as per the most recent national census. Deeper reds indicate more Aussies are of a certain age. We can see quickly that there is higher number of Australians aged 48 to 50, compared the Australians in their mid-40s and early-50s. More interested users can hover their house over a cell to see the exact number of Australians of any age, known as a tooltip. With minimal space, we can represented both proportional numbers (via colours) and absolute numbers (via tooltips).\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n# Load 2021 Australian census data on age and gender\ncensus_data <- read_csv(\n  file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-lab/2021_census_stats/main/data/2021_sex-and-age.csv\",\n  col_names = c('age', 'male', 'female', 'total'),\n  col_select = c('age', 'total'),\n  col_types = list(col_integer()),\n  skip = 1,\n  show_col_types = FALSE)\nojs_define(census_data = census_data)\n\n\ncensus_data_transposed = transpose(census_data)\nimport {addTooltips} from \"@mkfreeman/plot-tooltip\"\n\naddTooltips(\n  Plot.barX(census_data_transposed, {\n    x: \"age\",\n    interval: 1,\n    fill: \"total\",\n    inset: 0, \n    title: (d) => d.total + \" Australians\" + \"\\n are \" + d.age + \" years old\"\n  }).plot({\n    color: {\n      type: \"linear\",\n      scheme: \"reds\", \n      legend: false\n    },\n    x: {label: \"Age (years)\"},\n    style: {paddingTop: 50}\n  })\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphic above was made using the language of Observable JS. The creators of the language run a website called ObservableHQ, where users can create notebooks of all kinds of interesting visualisations. I took my first steps into Observable JS with a data visualisation course run by Robert Kosara. I thought it was a useful primer for general data visualisation, Observable JS, and ObservableHQ.\nAs part of the course, I explored pizza orders. I found Veggie pizza was the seasonal underdog. In 2022, Californians purchases of Veggie pizza was the most volatile of all pizzas across the year, with peaks on public holidays.\n\n\nObservableHQ notebooks are really neat. But, if you prefer R, check out how to make interactive documents by combining Observable JS and R.\nI’ll definitely be using Observable JS in the future!\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{andreotta2023,\n  author = {Matthew Andreotta},\n  title = {First Impressions of {Observable} {JS:} {A} Language for\n    Interactive Data Visualisations},\n  date = {2023-04-21},\n  url = {https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/observablehq},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMatthew Andreotta. 2023. “First Impressions of Observable JS: A\nLanguage for Interactive Data Visualisations.” April 21, 2023. https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/observablehq."

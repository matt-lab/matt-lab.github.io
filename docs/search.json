I blend psychology with data science techniques to identify meaningful patterns in social media data that reflect public perceptions and opinions. I have applied my methods to pressing societal issues, such as climate change, the influence of misinformation, and detection of research with misconduct or integrity concerns. More broadly, I aim to make science more accessible to scientists and the public alike. A more comprehensive account of my history can be found in my academic curriculum vitae.\nI hold a postdoctoral fellowship at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The aim of my current research is to develop semi-automated approaches to monitor social acceptance and social change concerning the marine environment. Building on social psychology theory and current advances in Big Data, I aim to pre-empt conflict and identify the antecedents of public support.\nI am open to collaborations, invitations for guest lectures, co-supervision of students, and projects that increase the accessibility of science.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The abstract for the peer-reviewed research paper is available below:\n\nMounting evidence suggests members of the general public are not homogeneous in their receptivity to climate science information. Studies segmenting climate change views typically deploy a top-down approach, whereby concepts salient in scientific literature determine the number and nature of segments. In contrast, in two studies using Australian citizens, we used a bottom-up approach, in which segments were determined from perceptions of climate change concepts derived from citizen social media discourse. In Study 1, we identified three segments of the Australian public (Acceptors, Fencesitters, and Sceptics) and their psychological characteristics. We find segments differ in climate change concern and scepticism, mental models of climate, political ideology, and worldviews. In Study 2, we examined whether reception to scientific information differed across segments using a belief-updating task. Participants reported their beliefs concerning the causes of climate change, the likelihood climate change will have specific impacts, and the effectiveness of Australia’s mitigation policy. Next, participants were provided with the actual scientific estimates for each event and asked to provide new estimates. We find significant heterogeneity in the belief-updating tendencies of the three segments that can be understood with reference to their different psychological characteristics. Our results suggest tailored scientific communications informed by the psychological profiles of different segments may be more effective than a `one-size-fits-all’ approach. Using our novel audience segmentation analysis, we provide some practical suggestions regarding how communication strategies can be improved by accounting for segments’ characteristics.\n\nYou can read more about this research in the freely-available preprint.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{andreotta2022,\n  author = {Matthew Andreotta},\n  title = {New Article: “{Evidence} for Three Distinct Climate Change\n    Audience Segments with Varying Belief Updating Tendencies”},\n  date = {2022-10-06},\n  url = {https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2022-10-06_new-article},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMatthew Andreotta. 2022. “New Article: ‘Evidence for Three\nDistinct Climate Change Audience Segments with Varying Belief Updating\nTendencies’.” October 6, 2022. https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2022-10-06_new-article."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety received a total of 10,574 submissions, 6,800 telephone calls to an information line, and heard 641 witnesses. These submissions lead to two reports: an Interim Report in 2019 and a Final Report in 2021. In the Interim and Final Report, we found mentions of the word “pain”. This is isn’t entirely surprising, given pain affects the vast majority of older Australians, and is often under-diagnosed and under-treated. What was surprising was that in the Royal Commissions 148 recommendations to improve aged care, there was not a single mention of the word pain. Although the Royal Commission discussed pain in their reports, the topic was omitted from recommendations, reflecting a lack of attention to the presented evidence. Without specific recommendations for pain management, a disconnection may arise between targeted polices, funding schemes, and the clinical practice. Thus, older adults living in the community and residential aged care homes may remain vulnerable.

    "title": "First impressions of Observable JS: A language for interactive data visualisations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When analysing text, often I want to visualise the aggregate characteristic of a document or corpus. For example, in a sentiment analysis, I might want to showing the average number of words associated with each emotion in each document. This reduces entire documents to a single point on a visualisation, which can allow readers to intuitively grasp the variation of emotions between documents. But, this form of visualisation does not give readers an intuitive sense of which part of a document contains emotional content, or even what word is related to which emotion. The most curious of readers might read up on the details of the sentiment analysis, but many won’t, leaving readers untrusting or uncertain of the analysis and results.\nI think interactive data visualisations can help here. Broadly, interactive data visualisations are graphical representations of data which respond to user input, such as a click of a mouse or numbers typed into a keyboard. Interaction can be used to clarify specific data values or hand over control to readers. For example, the graphic below represents the number of Australians for each year of age, as per the most recent national census. Deeper reds indicate more Aussies are of a certain age. We can see quickly that there is higher number of Australians aged 48 to 50, compared the Australians in their mid-40s and early-50s. More interested users can hover their house over a cell to see the exact number of Australians of any age, known as a tooltip. With minimal space, we can represented both proportional numbers (via colours) and absolute numbers (via tooltips).\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n# Load 2021 Australian census data on age and gender\ncensus_data <- read_csv(\n  file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-lab/2021_census_stats/main/data/2021_sex-and-age.csv\",\n  col_names = c('age', 'male', 'female', 'total'),\n  col_select = c('age', 'total'),\n  col_types = list(col_integer()),\n  skip = 1,\n  show_col_types = FALSE)\nojs_define(census_data = census_data)\n\n\ncensus_data_transposed = transpose(census_data)\nimport {addTooltips} from \"@mkfreeman/plot-tooltip\"\n\naddTooltips(\n  Plot.barX(census_data_transposed, {\n    x: \"age\",\n    interval: 1,\n    fill: \"total\",\n    inset: 0, \n    title: (d) => d.total + \" Australians\" + \"\\n are \" + d.age + \" years old\"\n  }).plot({\n    color: {\n      type: \"linear\",\n      scheme: \"reds\", \n      legend: false\n    },\n    x: {label: \"Age (years)\"},\n    style: {paddingTop: 50}\n  })\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphic above was made using the language of Observable JS.

I took my first steps into Observable JS with a data visualisation course run by Robert Kosara. I thought it was a useful primer for general data visualisation, Observable JS, and ObservableHQ.\nAs part of the course, I explored pizza orders. I found Veggie pizza was the seasonal underdog. In 2022, Californians purchases of Veggie pizza was the most volatile of all pizzas across the year, with peaks on public holidays.\n\n\nObservableHQ notebooks are really neat.

We compared the performance of AI tools (GPT-4-Turbo, Elicit) to human reviewers in extracting methods and findings from 33 peer-reviewed community-based fisheries management papers. Generally, the AI tools were not reliable in identifying whether an article had, or did not have, data relevant to the research question.

Our research found that the large-language model could not create a sensible strategy for identifying relevant literature (e.g., what to type into a search bar). However, when given an article, the large-language model and human team generally agreed on the articles relevance.

People who think climate change is either not happening, or caused by natural fluctuations unrelated to humans.Fencesitters. People who do not lean either way.We found that each segment had their own unique psychological characteristics which underpin their openness to climate science information. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of communication varies for each individual, and a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is not optimal. Using our findings, we provided some practical recommendations for tailoring climate change communication to each segment.\n            \n        \n        \nAtee, M., Andreotta, M., Morris, T., & Alford, M.

The data collected by HammondCare allowed us to quantify the prevalence of referrals prescribed two or more psychotropics. Psychotropics, such as antipsychotics, are commonly used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation) in people living with dementia. There are safety concerns with using more than two antipsychotics, but co-prescribing multiple classes of psychotropics may have a greater harm to those living with dementia, such as sedation-induced falls and delirium. Yet, we found most people living with dementia referred to HammondCare was prescribed two or more antipsychotics. Reducing prescriptions of psychotropics should be considered a priority for those living with dementia, as the risks of these agents outweigh their benefits.\n            \n        \n        \nCalder, S., Andreotta, M., Morris, T., & Atee, M.

For example, pastoral care is a broad service that involves religious, spiritual, emotional, and social support for people during difficult times. In this research, we developed and tested a digital tool to measure pastoral care, including who was receiving pastoral care, what form of care was provided, and the time taken to provide the care.After a one-year trial, we found our digital tool was well-used and well-received. Those providing pastoral care felt it was more feasible, favourable, and easier to use than paper-based recording. Our study demonstrates how broad services may be quantified to record, monitor, and improve caregiving to vulnerable people.\n            \n        \n        \n2021\nEcker, U. K. H., Sze, B. K.

Some theorists propose that people may continue to rely on misinformation because it is consistent with their political views of the world. To test this, we investigated whether Americans' political beliefs affected reliance on false information even after being corrected. While political beliefs influenced people's initial response, the correction was equally effective for both Democrats and Republicans. However, Republicans did show stronger emotional responses to information that conflicted with their beliefs. Our results suggest retracting false information is effective, even in polarising political contexts. Though, communicators should be weary of expressions of anger when retracting misinformation consistent with the views of Republicans.\n            \n        \n        \n2019\nAndreotta, M., Nugroho, R., Hurlstone, M.

    "text": "Why study public views of marine resources?\nMarine resources and space are a heated area of conservation, economic growth, livelihood, and employment. Industry, government, academia, and the public (and different subgroups amongst them) will inevitably hold different expectations, aspirations, and concerns about how society should use marine resources. If not properly managed, concerns and unfulfilled aspirations may erode public acceptance of industry activity and government policy.\nConcerns, fears, and expectations are social constructs. They arise within groups when people share knowledge and opinions, drawing on past experiences, analogies, aspirations about the future, perceptions of costs and benefits and power relations, among other drivers. At times, these fears and expectations feature in public discourse, such as traditional media, social media, and academia, where they develop into narratives defining a problem in novel or pre-existing terms. Some of the most divisive narratives are moral. That is, discussions can become embedded with core beliefs and convictions concerning what is right and wrong. This transforms discussions of a specific marine resource to discussions of society and identity. As a result, people who hold moralised perspectives tend to be harder to persuade1 and more hostile to those with opposing views2.\nSocial media is particularly fertile ground for moralisation. Moralised content is more likely to receive comments, and these comments tend to be moralised3. This effect, known as a moral contagion, suggests moralised discourse is likely to proliferate through social media networks. But we know little about how moralised discourse evolves over long time periods and what events might trigger lasting changes in the way the public moralise marine issues. For this reason, I’ll be exploring how and which marine resources are moralised. If this sounds interesting to you, please get in touch."

The basis for moral concerns are ‘foundational’, in the sense that they are recurrent themes that transcend issues and societies. The foundation of care reflects virtues of kindness and gentleness, featured in environmental concerns about harming ‘mother earth’, animal life, and fellow humans. The foundation of fairness reflects virtues of justice, rights, and reciprocity, featured in environmental concerns about justice for future generations who might carry the cost of today’s generation. The foundation of loyalty reflects virtues of patriotism and self-sacrifice for one’s in-group, featured in concerns that national economic performance may be weakened to sustain the environment. The foundation of respect reflects virtues of leadership and followership, featured in concerns about traditions surrounding natural resources. The foundation of sanctity reflects an eclectic range of virtues of cleanliness, holiness, and self-control, featured in environmental concerns for pollution and religious concerns for the environment.\n\n\n\n\nAn illustration of Moral Foundations Theory created by Aprilia Muktirina CC BY 4.0\n\n\n\nAs part of this research, I’ll be examining moral content at different granular levels using a natural language processing algorithm.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In April 2022, I started a postdoctoral fellowship at CSIRO. My project—titled “Automated monitoring of social change: applications to Social License to Operate in the Blue Economy”—involves developed automated systems to monitor social acceptance of marine projects, science, and governance. To this end, I have applied a number of Natural Language Processing techniques to understand public perceptions and media portrayals. In this post, I will share my experiences of these tools and my findings.\n\n\n\nMy Natural Language Processing approaches and applications\n\n\n\nTopic detection\nThe threat of climate change to the health of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is undisputed. However, news reporting about the GBR in recent years has sometimes failed to accurately convey the risks to the GBR of a heating climate, fuelling discourses of climate change denial on social media. One such instance occurred in 2022, in which a media release by an Australian government research agency about the state of coral cover growth on the GBR led to inaccurate news reporting, and a spike in online climate science denial in the days following its release.\nTypically social science approaches could be used to understand the media coverage, of 28 articles. However, the social media commentary could not be handled manually, wherein 59,586 tweets were shared within four weeks of the GBR news. Instead, I relied on a Natural Language Processing technique called topic modelling to identify the main themes in the social media commentary.\nThe goal of topic modelling is to identify topics, which are coherent collections of words that capture an abstract concept. Although a variety of topic modelling techniques, often the exercise involves estimate topic-word distributions (ideally, a small set of words have a high association with a topic) and topic-document distributions (documents can consist of multiple topics). Typically, a researcher will need to specify the number of topics, which requires some trial-and-error. For this case, fourteen topics work best. Then, for each topic, we manually explored whether these topics related to coral coverage, and if so, we then determined whether the topic related to climate change scepticism. You can read more about our work in our preprint, titled “Steering Great Barrier Reef climate science narratives through the mediasphere in a time of misinformation”.\n\n\n\nAn simplified example of topics. Topics are characterised by their topic-document (upper lines) and topic-word (bottom lines) distribution. For example, in this instance, the documents with the greatest proportion of the “Doomsday” topic (e.g., “nature continues to prove climate change doomsters wrong #GreatBarrierReef”) are particularly likely to contain the words “predictions”, “doomsdayers”, and “doomsters”\n\n\n\n\nSentiment analysis\nMy colleagues were interested in monitoring newspaper articles, in order to build a digital twin of conflict. Previously, they have used manual coding to discern media sentiment, which can be time-consuming and expensive. So, we teamed up to explore the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to automate this process.\nFor the social scientist, there are a few ‘out-of-the-box’ tools available. Very generally, we can consider two kinds of tools. The first ‘out-of-the-box’ tool are rules-based tools that rely on a pre-defined dictionary (list of words) of positive or negative sentiment. To a degree, some further rules can be added, such as reversal of sentiment when a negation is present (but this detection too, may be rules-based). The second ‘out-of-the-box’ tools are machine learning tools trained on a large corpus of text. Previously, machine learning tools were relatively inaccessible to social scientists, due to a lack of technical knowledge of machine learning techniques. Now, social scientists can interact with machine learning tools through user-friendly interfaces, such as ChatGPT’s interface for Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models.\nBut should they?\nThe performance of text-completion models, such as GPT, can be highly variable. The optimistic user might refer to this behaviour as ‘prompt engineering’, which suggests that the user can guide the model to produce the desired output. I am not optimistic in nature, so I was interested in whether deliberate changes to ‘improve’ the prompt (following prompt-engineering advice) would lead to a more accurate sentiment analysis. Generally, I found huge variability in the sentiment analysis. I found that prompts that performed well for one version of GPT (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) were not guaranteed to perform well for other versions. In addition, sometimes GPT models were outperformed by more transparent and simple rules-based tools.\nIn an upcoming paper, I will present my findings in detail and advise social scientists on how best to use these tools.\n\n\nMoral language classification\n\n“They wanna use the Great Barrier Reef as a rubbish tip! Says everything you need to know about this corrupt government #auspol” - a tweet (paraphrased to protect anonymity)\n\nThe above tweet exemplifies moral judgements. These are convictions about what is right/wrong, just/unjust, holy/unholy. Moral judgements are critical to understanding public attitudes towards marine resources and their management. Those who hold moral judgements about a topic can be intolerant to disagreement and harder to persuade. Passionate, or perhaps vitriolic comments, abound on social media, which can be a good source for understanding some of moral perspectives of the public. Fortunately, there is at least a decade of literature that has developed tools to classify moral language.\n\n\n\nMoral Foundations Theory. Moral Foundations Theory suggests that moral judgements are based on at least five moral foundations: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. Each foundation has corresponding virtues and vices.\n\n\nPsychologists have used Moral Foundation Theory to understand moral judgements as a set of five moral foundations: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity (or sanctity). A social scientist might rely on so-called Moral Foundation Dictionaries—list of words associated with each foundation. More recently, data scientists have developed machine learning tools to classify moral language.\nI used these automated tools to explore how climate change contrarians use moral language in their tweets about the GBR. I found that climate change contrarians were more likely than other users discussing climate change and the GBR to: (1) use moral language, and (2) reference vices of cheating and subversion, whereas other users discussing climate change were more likely to discuss the vice of harm (relative to other vices). My findings suggest the language of climate change contrarians is underscored by a unique moral signature, which could be useful for identifying and countering dis/misinformation.\nI presented my findings at a workshop in the University in Melbourne—titled “Detecting and responding to moralised misinformation”—for academics and industry interested in understanding misinformation.\n\n\nConclusion\nIf you are interested in learning more about my work, or collaborating, please feel free to reach out to me.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{andreotta2024,\n  author = {Andreotta, Matthew},\n  title = {My Postdoctoral Fellowship at {CSIRO}},\n  date = {2024-08-23},\n  url = {https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2024-08-23_postdoc-so-far},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAndreotta, Matthew. 2024. “My Postdoctoral Fellowship at\nCSIRO.” August 23, 2024. https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2024-08-23_postdoc-so-far."

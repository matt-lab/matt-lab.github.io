  <title>New article: “Does pain matter in the Australian Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety? A text mining study”</title>

<p>In the early months of 2022, I worked as a researcher for <em>HammondCare</em>, a not-for-profit Australian organisation. HammondCare delivers aged care and health services in hospital, residential, home, and community settings. During my time with the organisation, I worked with a team of scientists to research and improve aged care practices. This goal was critical, as in 2021, an Australian Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety recommended a profound shift in practices, in order to “provide high quality care that is predictable, reliable and delivered through a system which is sustainable” (<a href="https://agedcare.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/final-report-volume-1">The Royal Commission’s Final Report</a> pg., 3). From my time with HammondCare, I helped write <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08854726.2022.2091837">a peer-reviewed feasibility study of a digital tool to track pastoral care activities</a>, a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajag.13121">letter to the editor on the adoption of a mobile service funded by the Australian Government to respond to severe or very severe behaviours of people with dementia living in residential aged care homes</a>, and <a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.065304">a short piece on the co-prescription of multiple classes of psychotropics to people with neuropsychiatric symptoms referred to an Australian dementia support service</a>. But in a new article published at <em>Aging and Health Research</em>, my HammondCare colleagues and I studied the Royal Commission itself.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety received a total of 10,574 submissions, 6,800 telephone calls to an information line, and heard 641 witnesses. These submissions lead to two reports: an Interim Report in 2019 and a Final Report in 2021. In the Interim and Final Report, we found mentions of the word “pain”. This is isn’t entirely surprising, given pain affects the vast majority of older Australians, and is often under-diagnosed and under-treated. What was surprising was that in the Royal Commissions 148 recommendations to improve aged care, there was not a single mention of the word pain. Although the Royal Commission discussed pain in their reports, the topic was omitted from recommendations, reflecting a lack of attention to the presented evidence. Without specific recommendations for pain management, a disconnection may arise between targeted polices, funding schemes, and the clinical practice. Thus, older adults living in the community and residential aged care homes may remain vulnerable. If this topic interests you, you can read more about it in the open access article at <em>Aging and Health Research</em> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667032123000100">here</a>.</p>

  <title>Helpful Australian demographics for building representative samples of adults</title>
  <dc:creator>Matthew Andreotta</dc:creator>
  <link>https://matt-lab.github.io/posts/2023-02-03_census/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>When trying to match Australia’s population demographics to my survey sample’s demographics, I sometimes find the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ reporting cumbersome. Namely, ten-year and five-year categorisation of ages combines children and adults in a 15-19 year category. This leaves me scratching my head over how many 18 and 19 year olds to include in my study of Australian adults. To alleviate this problem, I’ve reported some census statistics on Australian adults, which you can find <a href="https://matt-lab.github.io/2021_census_stats/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe they will help you too?</p>

  <title>New article: “Evidence for three distinct climate change audience segments with varying belief updating tendencies”</title>
  <dc:creator>Matthew Andreotta</dc:creator>

<p>My research paper, titled “Evidence for three distinct climate change audience segments with varying belief updating tendencies: Implications for climate change communication” has just been accepted for publication in <em>Climatic Change</em>. Co-authored by my PhD supervisors, the paper describes the survey and psychological experiments from the final chapters of my PhD thesis. We identified three segments of Australians with different perceptions of climate change, where each segment was underscored by a unique signature of psychological characteristics and belief-updating tendencies. Based on these psychological profiles, we recommend specific strategies for communicating climate change with each segment.</p>
<p>The abstract for the peer-reviewed research paper is available below:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mounting evidence suggests members of the general public are not homogeneous in their receptivity to climate science information. Studies segmenting climate change views typically deploy a top-down approach, whereby concepts salient in scientific literature determine the number and nature of segments. In contrast, in two studies using Australian citizens, we used a bottom-up approach, in which segments were determined from perceptions of climate change concepts derived from citizen social media discourse. In Study 1, we identified three segments of the Australian public (Acceptors, Fencesitters, and Sceptics) and their psychological characteristics. We find segments differ in climate change concern and scepticism, mental models of climate, political ideology, and worldviews. In Study 2, we examined whether reception to scientific information differed across segments using a belief-updating task. Participants reported their beliefs concerning the causes of climate change, the likelihood climate change will have specific impacts, and the effectiveness of Australia’s mitigation policy. Next, participants were provided with the actual scientific estimates for each event and asked to provide new estimates. We find significant heterogeneity in the belief-updating tendencies of the three segments that can be understood with reference to their different psychological characteristics. Our results suggest tailored scientific communications informed by the psychological profiles of different segments may be more effective than a `one-size-fits-all’ approach. Using our novel audience segmentation analysis, we provide some practical suggestions regarding how communication strategies can be improved by accounting for segments’ characteristics.</p>

<p>Today, I upload a new version of my academic website. All thanks to the magic of <span class="emoji" data-emoji="sparkles">✨</span> Quarto <span class="emoji" data-emoji="sparkles">✨</span>.</p>
<p>For the unaware, Quarto is an open-source publishing system. I first started using Quarto to seamlessly use Python and R in the same markdown document. But Quarto can do so much more: books, presentations, and of course, websites.</p>
<p>Overall, the process of building rather painless. Partly because Quarto has comprehensive documentation and partly because I followed the footsteps of those before me. For readers interested in building a website with Quarto, here are the websites I found useful:</p>

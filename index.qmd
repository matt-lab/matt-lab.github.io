:::{#about}

In their wake, humans leave behind behavioural 'footprints', such as clicks on a webpage, text in a social media post, or numbers in a survey. I synthesise this complex data into clear insights by identifying critical patterns of human behaviour. My work blends principles of psychology with advanced data science to uncover meaningful intelligence from these digital and behavioral traces.

My recent work as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) involved leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), to understand human behaviour, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions. I've applied these methods to pressing societal issues, including environmental concerns, climate change, and the influence of misinformation. My professional experience is summarised in my <a href="https://matt-lab.github.io/assets/cv-academic/cv.pdf">Industry CV</a> whereas my academic experience is summarised in my <a href="https://matt-lab.github.io/assets/cv-industry/cv.pdf">Academic CV</a>.

I am passionate about translating intricate data into clear, compelling narratives that inform strategic decisions and drive tangible outcomes. My interests span critical areas such as environment, health, and investigations into fraud and corruption.

Currently, I am looking for work. As I transition from my postdoctoral role, I am actively seeking challenging opportunities where I can apply my technical skills and collaborate with others for impact. I am particularly interested in roles as a research scientist, data analyst, data scientist, fraud investigator, or treatment assessor.

Please explore my <a href="https://matt-lab.github.io/publications.html">publications</a> and <a href="https://matt-lab.github.io/presentations.html">presentations</a> to learn more about my work.

Today, I upload a new version of my academic website.
All thanks to the magic of :sparkles: Quarto :sparkles:.

For the unaware, Quarto is an open-source publishing system.
I first started using Quarto to seamlessly use Python and R in the same markdown document.
But Quarto can do so much more: books, presentations, and of course, websites.

Overall, the process of building rather painless.
Partly because Quarto has comprehensive documentation and partly because I followed the footsteps of those before me.
For readers interested in building a website with Quarto, here are the websites I found useful:

When trying to match Australia's population demographics to my survey sample's demographics, I sometimes find the Australian Bureau of Statistics' reporting cumbersome.
Namely, ten-year and five-year categorisation of ages combines children and adults in a 15-19 year category.
This leaves me scratching my head over how many 18 and 19 year olds to include in my study of Australian adults.
To alleviate this problem, I've reported some census statistics on Australian adults, which you can find [here](https://matt-lab.github.io/2021_census_stats/).

Maybe they will help you too?

In early October, I co-presented with [Dr. Blake Cavve](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/c/blake-cavve/) at the Telethon Kids Institute.
Together, we explored the 'grey area' of acceptable research practice and communication.
When conducting research, psychologists face a number of decisions when analysing data and communicating their results (e.g., what outliers to exclude from an analysis).
The basis for these decisions are not always known and not all decisions are disclosed in publications.
For some, the motivations to publish can shape decisions, known as "questionable research practices", and create a misleading science.
In this interactive presentation, we explored what questionable research practices are, how they come to be, how they may be mitigated, and red flags to look out for in the literature.
